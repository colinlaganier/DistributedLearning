Logs and statistics from each training run will be saved here. The logs are saved in the TensorBoard format, and can be viewed using TensorBoard. The statistics are saved in the CSV format, and can be viewed using any spreadsheet software.

To view the logs, run the following command in the terminal:
```
tensorboard --logdir='/your/path/here'
```
Then, open the URL (http://localhost:6006/) that is printed in the terminal in your browser.
